Area Focused
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Created the calculator with the model or Realme 7 pro.
2) Made sure that 2 operators cannot be typed without an operand in between.
3) The below area of the result (output) of the calculator is the dynamic calculation happen,
    made sure that it also clears with the clear button, after calculation submission(pressing '=')
    and also while putting new operand after calculation.
4) After pressing '=' the any new operands pressed will clear the existing answer and new calculation
    begins, if an operator is pressed the calculation will continue.
5) Multiplication and Division sign is added as a normal calculator.
6) The result in float can have only maximum of two decimal points.
